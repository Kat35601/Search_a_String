<p>Can you find the names of 25 books of the Bible in this paragraph? This is a most remarkable puzzle.
 Someone found it in the seat pocket on a flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu, keeping himself occupied for hours.
  One man from Illinois worked on this while fishing from his john boat. Roy Clark studied it while playing his banjo.
  Elaine Victs mentioned it in her column once. One woman judges the job to be so involving, she brews a cup of tea to
  help calm her nerves. There will be some names that are really easy to spot that’s a fact. Some people will soon find
  themselves in a jam, especially since the book names are not necessarily capitalized. The truth is, from answers
  we get, we are forced to admit it usually takes a minister or scholar to see some of them at the worst.
  Something in our genes is responsible for the difficulty we have. Those able to find all of them will hear
  great lamentations from those who have to be shown. One revelation may help, books like! Timothy and Samuel
  may occur without their numbers. And punctuation or spaces in the middle are normal.
  A chipper attitude will help you compete. Remember, there are 25 books of the Bible lurking
 somewhere in this paragraph. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13.</p>
